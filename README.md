# KrakenPrices

Task description:

A small application needs to be created that will allow viewing real-time prices from the Kraken crypto exchange. The application should display all current prices from this exchange.
Requirements:
  * prices must be retrieved using WebSocket connection
  * using REST API to fetch prices is not allowed, and making request at the moment of page load is also not acceptable
  * the REST API should be used only to fetch the list of trading pairs
  * application needs to be implemented in Elixir, using Phoenix framework
  * no database should be used 

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
